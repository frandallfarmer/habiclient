This is a list of sounds that are available as of 7/22/86.  They live in
aric/mic/Sounds (macross source files) and aric/mic/Sounds/Bin (binary
versions).

When adding SFX calls, please remember:
The names followed by "_pw" require two SFX to be queued, not one.  The
second SFX is the first + "_pw".  For example: avatar_injured and
avatar_injured_pw.  The _pw is the sfx data block for the pulse width part
of the sound.

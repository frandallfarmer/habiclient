/u0/chip/habitat/muddle:
	This directory contains the utilities Muddle and Puddle.  Muddle
generates the C64 Habitat disk database files (.dat files) from a
specification file written in the Muddle specification language (a .mud file).
Puddle is a post-processor that takes an old .dat file and a new one and
creates a composite .dat file with the same content as the "new" input but
with the minimum possible number of changes from the "old" input.

	Muddle is described in detail in a document in the documentation
directory.

These are the files here:

Quick documentation for Puddle:

puddle oldfile newfile [ outputfile ]

"oldfile" and "newfile" should both be .dat files of the same type (e.g.,
head.dat, etc.).  "outputfile" is the optional output file.  If not given the
output goes to stdout.  Puddle compares the content of both inputs and
generates a new .dat file that has all the content of the 'new' input with
minimal changes (in terms of track/sector updates required) from the 'old'
input.

Once you have the composite .dat file, you can use my deltab utility (located
in my toolBox directory).  Just type

deltab oldfile compositefile

and it will give you a list of the blocks that differ.
